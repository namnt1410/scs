About real DNA sequences



*DNA sequences are obtained from NCBI Viral Genomes, Accessed on 01/01/2006. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VIRUSES/viruses.html.

Sequences are randomly selected from different genome sequences.
Seuqences datasets are truncated to specific length(K) and number(N) of sequences.

Each of the settings have 10 datasets, and dataset number i is named DNA_NXXX_KXXX_i.
There are 60 sequences datasets in total.
